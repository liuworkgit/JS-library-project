# JS Library Project
This is a web app that allows the user to manage a collection of books.

This project was made according to the specifications of [The Odin Project's Library Project, which you can access here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)

## Status Update - June 20 2024
The current goal is to **refactor the object parsing function so it matches with the new entry format.** After, I will begin **updating the design and visuals of the website.**

## User Stories
This project will have the following functionality:

1. It will display all the stored books on the page, showing their title, author, number of pages, and whether or not they've been read.
2. Users will be able to add a new book. When adding a new book, they will have the option to input information about said book.
3. Users will be able to remove a book by pressing a button beside a book's listing.
4. Users will be able to mark a book as read or unread by pressing a button beside a book's listing.

## Future Goals
I intend to implement these goals after the fundamental user stories have been completed:
1. Fix the "new book" form to the right of the page.
2. Set up server and database support to allow users to upload books to a server.
3. Allow users to upload book covers.
4. Add statistics, such as number of books read or unread.
